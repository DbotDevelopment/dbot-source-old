## How do I start?
[invite](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=798144456528363550&scope=bot&permissions=8&scope=applications.commands) Dbot to your server

### Moderation
Setting up your moderation is really easy. Let's add first a log channel. Do this, with `d!logchannel enable [mention channel]` All logs will now appear here! Awesome, right? You should also have a muterole, to mute, of course. Lets do that with `d!muterole enable [mention role]`. Now you can use your mute commands! 

### Tickets
If you have a question, you make a ticket. Basic Discord. And guess what, Dbot can make the tickets! If you do `d!setup tickets` and give all information Dbot asks, you are ready to go! Use `d!setup ticketpanel` to add your ticketpanel. Give a nice title and description, and boom, the panel is there, in your ticket channel you gave!!

### Custom prefix
The default prefix of Dbot is **d!**. But if you want to have another prefix in your server, such as **!**. You can simply do that with `d!custom prefix [your prefix]`!

**‚ö†Ô∏è We always use `d!` in the tutorials! If you have your own prefix, change `d!` to your own prefix, `d!help` becomes `!help` ‚ö†Ô∏è**

### Reaction roles
When people join, you dont want to ask Them which role they want. No, you want a click system! Dbot can handle this really easy! With `d!rradd [reaction category name] [mention role] [emoji]` you can add it. If you then do `d!rrmsg [reaction category name]` it will send an embed with your reaction roles! You can also use `d!rrmsgadd [mention channel] [message id] [mention role] [emoji]` to add it to your own message! If you still think its difficult, you can watch the video:
